- 👋 Hi I’m Andrew, a third year undergraduate studying computer science at the University of Washington.
- 🖥 I'm experienced with Java, C/C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS and some Python.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things software, but particularly in technological developments related to sustainability.
- 🌱 I’m currently interning at Easy Street and taking security classes.
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to arindge@uw.edu. I'm looking for summer '23 internships!
