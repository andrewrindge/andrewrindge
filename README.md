- 👋 Hi, I’m @andrewrindge, a second year undergraduate at University of Washington studying computer science and minoring in data science.
- 🖥 I'm experienced with Java, C, JavaScript, HTML + CSS and a tiny bit of React and Python. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things software, but particularly neural networks and technological tools that can improve quality of life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development & OCaml!
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to arindge [@] uw.edu
