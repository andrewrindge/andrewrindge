- ðŸ‘‹ Hi Iâ€™m Andrew, a Software Engineer at Spectrum Pension Consultants and a recent CS grad from the University of Washington.
- ðŸ–¥ I'm experienced with Java, PHP. Python, JavaScript, SQL and some C. Recently lots of work with PHP (Laravel) and JavaScript!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things software, but particularly in technological developments related to sustainability.
- ðŸŒ± Outside of work I'm currently working on Cartridge Counter - a video game backlog and review app.
- ðŸ“„ Check out some of my previous personal projects: [Resplit](https://github.com/DavyHyun/ReSplit) (a receipt scanning app), [Blob Party](https://github.com/andrewrindge/blobparty) (an online chat space) or [Fly Kind](https://github.com/andrewrindge/flykind) (an eco-concious airline booking platform).
